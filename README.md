# kubegateway
An API Gateway for Kubernetes. Intended to be similar to [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), but open source and designed to be hosted in [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).

Note: this project is not yet implemented. I've created this repository for my notes at this point.
